@workspace I need help debugging TypeScript installation issue in VS Code extension project.

**PROJECT:** `E:\ECHO_XV4\MLS\servers\copilot_mcp_bridge\`

**PROBLEM:** TypeScript won't install despite being in devDependencies. Extension cannot compile.

**SYMPTOMS:**
```bash
cd E:\ECHO_XV4\MLS\servers\copilot_mcp_bridge
npm install              # ✅ Completes successfully  
npm run compile          # ❌ 'tsc' is not recognized
npx tsc -p ./            # ❌ "This is not the tsc command you are looking for"
dir node_modules\typescript    # ❌ File Not Found
dir node_modules\.bin          # ❌ Only has node-which, NO tsc.cmd
```

**PACKAGE.JSON DEVDEPENDENCIES:**
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@types/node": "^20.19.19",
  "@types/vscode": "^1.104.0",
  "@vscode/test-electron": "^2.3.0",
  "@vscode/vsce": "^2.22.0",
  "typescript": "^5.9.3"
}
```

**ENVIRONMENT:**
- Node.js: v24.9.0
- OS: Windows
- Shell: PowerShell / CMD

**WHAT I TRIED:**
1. `npm install` - completes but TypeScript missing
2. `npm install typescript --save-dev` - completes but still missing
3. `npm install --include=dev` - directory error
4. Deleted `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, reinstalled - same result

**QUESTIONS:**
1. Why isn't TypeScript installing when listed in devDependencies?
2. Is this a Node.js v24.9.0 compatibility issue?
3. Should I try `npm cache clean --force` first?
4. Alternative: use Yarn or PNPM instead?

**GOAL:** Get `npm run compile` working to generate `dist/extension.js`
