## 📋 MISSION BRIEF

**OBJECTIVE:** Complete Han Solo vs Boba Fett epic story and generate Morgan Freeman audio

**What Commander Wants:**
- Epic space battle: Millennium Falcon vs Slave I
- Falcon crash lands after battle
- Han and Chewie fight Fett on the ground

### TASK 2: Generate Audio (Morgan Freeman)

**Use Proven System:**

Settings: MAXIMUM emotional range (proven 10/10)
```

**Configuration:**
```python
STORY_PATH = r"E:\ECHO_XV4\HAN_SOLO_EPIC.txt"
AUDIO_DIR = r"E:\ECHO_XV4\HAN_AUDIO"
ECHO_VOICE_ID = "keDMh3sQlEXKM4EQxvvi"
MAX_CHUNK_SIZE = 4000
```

**Expected Output:**
- 15-20 audio parts
- ~60-90 minutes total
- Cost: ~$2-3 USD
- Quality: 10/10 (proven formula)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Sound Effects Question
Commander asked: **"Why no sound effects in the Kenobi story?"**

**ANSWER FOR NEXT THREAD:**
The maul_epic_audio.py script generates voice narration only. ElevenLabs text-to-speech creates spoken words, not sound effects. To add SFX (lightsaber clashes, explosions, screams), we would need:

1. **Sound effects library** (pre-recorded SFX files)
2. **Audio mixing script** to layer SFX over narration
3. **Timing markers** in the story to trigger SFX

**OPTIONS:**
- **Option A:** Pure narration (current - works perfectly)
- **Option B:** Add SFX layer with pygame audio mixing
- **Option C:** Use ElevenLabs Sound Effects API (if available)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Ask Commander if he wants SFX added to Han Solo story, or if pure Morgan Freeman narration (like Kenobi) is perfect as-is.
